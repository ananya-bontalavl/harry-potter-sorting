# harry-potter-sorting

A very basic c++ code to determine your harry potter house using 4 questions. Just run the sorting hat file and answer the questions in your terminal. It should give you a decent answer.
PS: I'm a ravenclaw <3!!


execute in your terminal!
Do not forget to download any c++ compiler according to your OS, I use gcc for the ease(windows)
bash:(windows code using gcc compiler)
path/to/your/saved/folder/> g++ sortinghat.cpp -o sortinghat
and then run : path/to/your/saved/folder/> sortinghat

These are some very beginner friendly mini programs, and that is why I am giving really simple instructions
